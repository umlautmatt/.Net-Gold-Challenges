Komodo Green Plan

add a Green Plan for  
customers that provides incentives for owning an Electric or 
Hybrid car. 

Before they are able to configure any pricing or deals, 
1. collect general information on Electric, Hybrid, and Gas cars
so that they can do various comparisons. 

  
collect, read(see), delete, and update data on gas, electric, and hybrid cars. 
To be more specific, they want to create an app that allows a 
Komodo Agent to do full CRUD + List on those three types of cars.

For example, a KI employee can go on and create
a Tesla, add it to an Electric Car list, update it, see the details 
for the car, and delete it from the Electric Car list. 
Electric List
Hybrid List
Gas List

They could also see a full list of Electric cars that have been added. 
They can do the same thing for Gas Cars and Hybrid Cars with the
eventual hope that the collected data will help with various comparisons. 

Be sure to Unit Test your code.
